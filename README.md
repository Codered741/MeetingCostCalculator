# MeetingCostCalculator
This is a simple timer/calculator which calculates the cost of your meeting in real time.  
It installs as a Click-Once application.  

To use, run the application, enter the hourly rate, the number of people, and click "Start".  The timer will start and immediately show the rollng cost of the meeting.  Click Stop, the timer will stop, and you can adjust the number of people or hourly rate.  You can then re-start the timer, which will continue at the new rate, adding the previous segments total to the new running total.  The segments will display in a list box to the side.  Selecting Reset will clear the list, and return the current value to 0.  

Enjoy.
